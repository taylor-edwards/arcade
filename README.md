# Arcade

Arcade is a small collection of (you guessed it) arcade games built at a
reasonably low effort, MVP-ish level development. Here's a list of games
currently included:

* [Tetris](http://motoroco.co/tetris)
* [Snake](http://motoroco.co/snake)

The [index page](http://motoroco.co) displays a directory of the games.

## Development

Use the command `npm run dev` to start a basic fileserver, then open
[localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) to view the site. You can directly
modify the files in the `public/` directory and refresh the webpage to
see your changes.
